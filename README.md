# Honda CBR1100XX Super Blackbird - AdapterBoard
This project incorporates a printed circuit board design that allows you to connect from the OEM Honda CBR1100XX Blackbird wiring harness to your stand-alone ECU of choice. This adapter board specifically targets the early 2000's model EFI Honda Blackbird.
  This PCB provides a means of connecting from the existing proprietary 22-pin Keihin female side connector that is part of the wiring harness to a set of standard Molex connectors, allowing you to design a custom wiring harness for your specific standalone ECU needs.
  This project has been designed in Kicad 6.0.11 under linux and is licensed under the TAPR Open Hardware License (www.tapr.org/OHL).
