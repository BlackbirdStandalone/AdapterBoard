# Honda CBR1100XX Super Blackbird - Wiring harness adapter board

This project incorporates a printed circuit board design that allows you to connect from the OEM Honda CBR1100XX Blackbird wiring harness to your stand-alone ECU of choice.
This adapter board specifically targets the early 2000's model EFI Honda Blackbird.

The existing wiring harness on the motorcycle is hard-wired to two proprietary 22-pin Keihin connectors (female side). These connectors directly mate with the Keihin ECU (male side pins) and are located underneath the seat at the rear of the motorcycle.

This PCB design provides a means of conveniently interfacing with the existing 22-pin connector to your specfic standalone ECU of choice without having to sever the existing wiring harness. A custom wiring harness can then be build to interface to the stand alone ECU via standard Molex connectors. The benefit of such an interface board also allows you to revert to the original Keihin ECU if you so wish.

This project has been designed in Kicad 6.0.11 under linux and is licensed under the TAPR Open Hardware License (www.tapr.org/OHL).
